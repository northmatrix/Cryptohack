so i sent my private key and my generator point
Nme 
G   
then they generated my public key and stored it
Nme* G = Qge now the next step should be for them to multiply with their private key but they dont 
i just need to give the info that matches my public key which i obviously have

// :IMPORTANT 

OK so we know it resets its state after each request so we cannot accumulate trust so we need to crack it insted of cheating it nowwe know a  few things  

we know the PUBLICKEY, the GENERATOR and we just need to find the private key  this can be done with discrete log so lets do some reaserch and gather the information

1 thing to mention is that we do have control over the generator field so we actually only need to find a generator point on the curve which when multiplied with our private key gives us the public key  

# GENERATOR POINT   WE CAN MODIFY
